    <description>Unlocks the offworld manufacturing plant, a powerful system which orbits the planet and allows you to craft most items automatically. It uses resources that are in range of trade beacons, and when it has completed a crafting 'Order', it will send the item down in a drop pod to a trade beacon. To access the Offworld Manufacturing Plant, build a Manufacturing Control Console and click the command button to open the UI.</description>
