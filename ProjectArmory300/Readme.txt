Project Armory Readme
===========================================

This mod adds new weapons to the RimWorld Universe from different games, movies and real world periods from the Victorian era to modern day. We try to match the function and the graphic to be ad close to the vanilla weapons as possible and make them as balanced as possible with a unique twist.

===========================================
Weapons Kit Switcher
===========================================

The Weapons Kit Switcher tool is located in the mod directory were you install your mods (.../Mods/ProjectArmory/Weapons Kit Switcher.exe). The tool allows you to activate and deactivate groups or single weapons so you don't have to use all of them if you don't want.

Make your own category:
It is possible to make custom kits in the switcher. The switcher reads the file name of the weapons and in turn makes the category. To add you own simply edit the [WorldTag], example: Modern, in to you own name and the switcher will recognize the new category.
